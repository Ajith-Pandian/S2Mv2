        Clipping views enables you to easily change the shape of a view.
        You can clip views for consistency with other design elements or to change the shape of a view in response to user input.
        You can clip a view to its outline area using the View.setClipToOutline() method or the android:clipToOutline attribute.
        Only rectangle, circle, and round rectangle outlines support clipping, as determined by the Outline.canClip() method.
